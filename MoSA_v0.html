<h1>Museum of Stolen Artifacts Ontology v0</h1>
<hr>      
    <p><i>For questions or criticisms, please contact Valentin (at &lt;valevogelmann <i>at</i>&gt; gmail <i>dot</i> com), who maintains this document.</i></p>
    <p>This is the first, basic version of the <i>Museum of Stolen Artifacts Ontology</i> (<i>MoSA</i> for short) and not even a draft, thus subject to constant changes. This is the document which can be referred to when structuring data using the MoSA ontology &mdash; all of the entities and predicates the MoSA ontology defines are listed below including their domains, ranges and relationships.
    </p>
<hr>      
<h2>Entities</h2>
    <p>Since we are taking an iterative and bottom-up approach, this ontology is not defined with as a hierarchy of entities with a top-level element. It means that we only define the entities we "need" for making data more useful and clarifying intentions. For instance, it also means that (for now) we don't make commitments about <i>what</i> the objects in the Museum of Stolen Artifacts are.</p>
      
      <h3>Layer Entities</h3>
      <p>We do want to distinguish the different "layers of existence" of that might (or might not) apply to an object, for now these are (1) of course its physical manifestation(s) and (2) digital records that witness their existence and describe them. The latter are, however, typically taken from institutions in those countries that have stolen them, and this is a core reason for making this distinction explicit: Separating objects from what different parties say about them, can allow us to question and contest.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Definition: A record in a digital collection, dataset, etc which witnesses or claims the existence of an object (physical or not) and describes typically aspects of it. </li>
                <li>Usage notes: This entity type mainly serves the purpose of bringing together information from various institutional collection systems but can explicitly also be used to create new records. Note, however, that of course an entry in the MoSA itself is also a <i>DigitalRecord</i> but we reserve this entity for representing <i>external</i> digital records.</li>

                            <a href=#assigned_title>assigned_title</a>: For human identification of records, it is covenient to have a title; could be forged in case not present in an original record.

                <li>Subclasses: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION: It could become useful to distinguish different kinds of <i>(Western)</i> museums?]</li>
                <li>Definition: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION: A (public) institution which holds an object in the MoSA, i.e. a stolen artefact, and is the provider of the information in a <a href="#DigitalRecord">DigitalRecord</a>.] </li>
                <li>Usage notes: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION: This entity class has been created on the fly out of the need to "name" entities like the British Museum, Wereldmuseum and Musei Vaticani. The name of this class as well as its meaning are very much open for debate.]</li>

                <li>Superclasses: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION: There could be more generic entities which connect to other events in an artefact's history.]</li>
                <li>Subclasses:

                        <li><a href=#ProvAcquisition>ProvAcquisition</a></li>
                        <li>[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]: Add other specific provenance types.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Definition: A generic <i>provenance</i> entry, i.e. any event or part of an artefact's history during or after its theft, and relating to how the artefact ended up in its current location.</li>
                <li>Usage notes: This class and all of its subclasses carry the name <i>provenance</i>, a term in used in Western historical and museological context to describe how (and why) an object got to its present location. It is supposed to be a neutral term for research purposes but masks or hides violences and injustices. We adopt the term here to describe what other institutions describe but don't identify with it.</li>

                <li>Definition: </li>
                <li>Usage notes: Much like its super class term <i>provenance</i>, the term <i>acquisition</i> is supposed to neutrally and generically describe how e.g. a state or museum came into possession of an object and masks that often these events were thefts, looting and other injust, violent actions. Like in the of the super class, we record the term because they use it./li>

<h3>Predicates pertaining to DigitalRecord</h3>

<p>These predicates may also be used in other contexts, re-use is in fact encouraged (e.g. <a href=#assigned_text>assigned_text</a> can be used for attaching any text to any entity). The reason for calling most predicates "assigned_" is to highlight the contestable nature of attributions.</p>
