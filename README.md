# MuseumofStolenArtefacts

## 1. Witnessing Artefacts

#### Guiding Questions

 - who has encountered/seen/witnessed artefacts? when? how?
 - where is an artefact currently held? how is it (digitally accessed?)
 - 

#### Rationales & Core Aspects

 - there are physical/real (although not necessarily material) objects (aka artefacts)
 - there are digital records; these may _witness_ artefacts or claim their existence (an artefact's existence and attributes are always described through a digital records)
 - coincidence of two digital records (i.e. they (possibly/probably/certainly) refer to the same physical object) is described by a relation between the phyiscal objects they are connected to
 - evidentiality from linguistics (verb aspect e.g. in Bulgarian); useful types of evidentiality (to complement the source itself) include:
   1. indicative (I have observed myself)
   2. inferential (knowing due to inference)
   3. renarrative (someone told me that)
   4. dubitative (I heard that but I have reason to doubt/who I heard from also hasn't observed)

 - recording the absence of an object (I know/believe/suspect that an object exists but have no record of it/don't know where it is held) 

#### Ontology Elements

 - physical object itself - basis for nearly everything else (because we're eventually interested in artefacts)
   - the cultural context it is from (denomination of the culture/group) & evidentiality of that
   - other objects that relate to the object (by being about the object, by describing it)
   - relationships between physical objects (through object categories, being potentially the same, parts of each other)  
 - digital records - the lens through which we interact with physical object
 - museums, institutions - entities that hold and, importantly, create and publish digital records about them
   - idetifiers about institutions themselves
   - policies, documents and other contextual materials about object status and restitution
   - (persistent) identifiers assigned by institutions for digital records
