# MuseumofStolenArtefacts

## 1. Witnessing Artefacts

## Guiding Questions

 - who has encountered artefacts? when? how?
 - where

## Rationales & Core Aspects

 - there are physical/real (although not necessarily material) objects (aka artefacts)
 - there are digital records; these may _witness_ artefacts or claim their existence (an artefact's existence and attributes are always described through a digital records)
 - coincidence of two digital records (i.e. they (possibly/probably/certainly) refer to the same physical object) is described by a relation between the phyiscal objects they are connected to
